## Publishing

- https://code.visualstudio.com/api/working-with-extensions/publishing-extension
- PAT, Personal Access Token:
  - https://frawa.visualstudio.com/_usersSettings/tokens
  - One easy mistake to make when creating the PAT (Personal Access Token) is to not select All accessible organizations in the Organizations field drop-down (instead selecting a specific organization). You should also set the Authorized Scopes to Marketplace (Manage) for the publish to work.
  - Organizations: All accessible organizations
  - Authorized Scopes: Marketplace (Manage)
